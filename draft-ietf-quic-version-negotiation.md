--- abstract

QUIC does not provide a complete version negotiation mechanism but instead only
provides a way for the server to indicate that the version the client offered
is unacceptable. This document describes a version negotiation mechanism that
allows a client and server to select a mutually supported version. Optionally,
if the original and negotiated version share a compatible first flight format,
the negotiation can take place without incurring an extra round trip.

# Introduction

The version-invariant properties of QUIC {{!INV=I-D.ietf-quic-invariants}}
define a version negotiation (VN) packet but do not specify how an endpoint
reacts when it receives one. QUIC version 1 {{!QUIC=I-D.ietf-quic-transport}}
allows the server to use a VN packet to indicate that the version the client
offered is unacceptable, but doesn't allow the client to safely make use of
that information to create a new connection with a mutually supported version.
With proper safety mechanisms in place, the VN packet can be part of a
mechanism to allow two QUIC implementations to negotiate between two totally
disjoint versions of QUIC, at the cost of an extra round trip. However, it is
beneficial to avoid that cost whenever possible, especially given that most
incremental versions are broadly similar to the the previous version.

This specification describes a simple version negotiation mechanism which
optionally leverages similarities between versions and can negotiate between
the set of "compatible" versions in a single round trip.


## Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


# Compatible Versions

If A and B are two distinct versions of QUIC, A is said to be "compatible" with
B if it is possible to take a first flight of packets from version A and
convert it into a first flight of packets from version B. As an example, if
versions A and B are absolutely equal in their wire image and behavior during
the handshake but differ after the handshake, then A is compatible with B and B
is compatible with A.

Version compatibility is not bijective: it is possible for version A to be
compatible with version B and for B not to be compatible with A. This could
happen for example if version B is a strict superset of version A.

Note that version compatibility does not mean that every single possible
instance of a first flight will succeed in conversion to the other version. A
first flight using version A is said to be "compatible" with version B if two
conditions are met: first that version A is compatible with version B, and
second that the conversion of this first flight to version B is well-defined.
For example, if version B is equal to A in all aspects except it introduced a
new frame in its first flight that version A cannot parse or even ignore, then
B could still be compatible with A as conversions would succeed for connections
where that frame is not used. In this example, first flights using version B
that carry this new frame would not be compatible with version A.

When a new version of QUIC is defined, it is assumed to not be compatible with
any other version unless otherwise specified. Similarly, no other version is
compatible with the new version unless otherwise specified. Implementations
MUST NOT assume compatibility between versions unless explicitly specified.

Note that both endpoints might disagree on whether two versions are compatible
or not. For example, two versions could have been defined concurrently and then
specified as compatible in a third document much later - in that scenario one
endpoint might be aware of the compatibility document while the other may not.


# Version Negotiation Mechanism

This document specifies two means of performing version negotiation: one
"incompatible" which requires a round trip and is applicable to all versions,
and one "compatible" that allows saving the round trip but only applies when
the versions are compatible.

The client initiates a QUIC connection by sending a first flight of QUIC
packets with a long header to the server {{INV}}. We'll refer to the version of
those packets as the "original version". The client's first flight includes
handshake version information (see {{hs-vers-info}}) which will be used to
optionally enable compatible version negotation (see {{compat-vn}}), and to
prevent version downgrade attacks (see {{downgrade}}).

Upon receiving this first flight, the server verifies whether it knows how to
parse first flights from the original version. If it does not, then it starts
incompatible version negotiation, see {{incompat-vn}}. If the server can parse
the first flight, it can either establish the connection using the original
version, or it MAY attempt compatible version negotiation, see {{compat-vn}}.

Note that it is possible for a server to have the ability to parse the first
flight of a given version without fully supporting it, in the sense that it
implements enough of the version's specification to parse first flight packets
but not enough to fully establish a connection using that version.


## Connections and Version Negotiation

QUIC connections are shared state between a client and a server {{INV}}. The
compatible version negotiation mechanism defined in this document (see
{{compat-vn}}) operates inside of a QUIC connection; i.e., the packets with the
original version are part of the same connection as the packets with the
negotiated version. On the other hand, the incompatible version negotiation
mechanism, which leverages QUIC Version Negotiation packets (see
{{incompat-vn}}) conceptually operates across two QUIC connections: one before
the Version Negotiation packet, and a distinct connection after.


## Incompatible Version Negotiation {#incompat-vn}

The server starts incompatible version negotiation by sending a VN packet,
listing all the versions that it does support.

Upon receiving the VN packet, the client will search for a version it supports
in the list provided by the server. If it doesn't find one, it aborts the
connection attempt. Otherwise, it selects a mutually supported version and
sends a new first flight with that version - we refer to this version as the
"negotiated version".

The new first flight will allow the endpoints to establish a connection using
the negotiated version. The handshake of the negotiated version will exchange
handshake version information (see {{hs-vers-info}}) required to ensure that VN
was genuine, i.e. that no attacker injected packets in order to influence the
VN process, see {{downgrade}}.


## Compatible Version Negotiation {#compat-vn}

When the server can parse the client's first flight using the original version,
it can extract the client's handshake version information (see
{{hs-vers-info}}). This contains the list of versions that the client thinks
its first flight is compatible with.

If the server supports one of the client's compatible versions, and the server
also believes that the original version is compatible with this version, then
the server converts the client's first flight to that version and replies to
the client as if it had received the converted first flight. The version used
by the server in its reply is refered to as the "negotiated version". The
server MUST NOT reply with a version that is not present in the client's
compatible versions, unless it is the original version.

If the server does not find a compatible version, it will use the original
version if it supports it, and if it doesn't then the server will perform
incompatible version negotiation instead, see {{incompat-vn}}.

For the duration of the compatible version negotiation process, clients MUST
use the same 5-tuple (source and destination IP addresses and UDP port
numbers). During that time, clients MUST also use the same Destination
Connection ID, except if the server explicitly instructs the client to use a
different Destination Connection ID (for example, a QUIC version 1 server can
accomplish this by sending an INITIAL packet with a Source Connection ID that
differed from the client's Destination Connection ID). This allows load
balancers to ensure that packets for a given connection are routed to the same
server.


# Handshake Version Information {#hs-vers-info}

During the handshake, endpoints will exchange handshake version information,
which is a blob of data that is defined below. In QUIC version 1, the handshake
version information is transmitted using a new transport parameter,
`version_negotiation`. The contents of handshake version information depend on
whether the client or server is sending it, and are shown below (using the
notation from the "Notational Conventions" section of {{QUIC}}):

~~~
Client Handshake Version Information {
  Currently Attempted Version (32),
  Previously Attempted Version (32),
  Received Negotiation Version Count (i),
  Received Negotiation Version (32) ...,
  Compatible Version Count (i),
  Compatible Version (32) ...,
}
~~~
{: #fig-client-hvi title="Client Handshake Version Information"}

The content of each field is described below:

Currently Attempted Version:

: The version that the client is attempting to use. This field MUST be equal to
the value of the Version field in the long header that carries this data.

Previously Attempted Version:

: If the client is sending this first flight in response to a Version
Negotiation packet, this field contains the version that the client used in the
previous first flight that triggered the version negotiation packet. If the
client did not receive a Version Negotiation packet, this field SHALL be
all-zeroes.

Received Negotiation Version Count:

: A variable-length integer specifying the number of Received Negotiation
Version fields following it. If the client is sending this first flight in
response to a Version Negotiation packet, the subsequent versions SHALL include
all the versions from that Version Negotiation packet in order, even if they
are not supported by the client (even if the versions are reserved). If the
client has not received a Version Negotiation packet on this connection, this
field SHALL be 0.

Compatible Version Count:

: A variable-length integer specifying the number of Compatible Version fields
following it. The client lists all versions that this first flight is
compatible with in the subsequent Compatible Version fields, ordered by
descending preference. Note that the version in the Currently Attempted Version
field MUST be included in the Compatible Version list to allow the client to
communicate the currently attempted version's preference. Note that this
preference is only advisory, servers MAY choose to use their own preference
instead.

~~~
Server Handshake Version Information {
  Negotiated Version (32),
  Supported Version Count (i),
  Supported Version (32) ...,
}
~~~
{: #fig-server-hvi title="Server Handshake Version Information"}

The content of each field is described below:

Negotiated Version:

: The version that the server chose to use for the connection. This field MUST
be equal to the value of the Version field in the long header that carries this
data.

Supported Version Count:

: A variable-length integer specifying the number of Supported Version fields
following it. The server encodes all versions it supports in the subsequent
list, ordered by descending preference. Note that the version in the Negotiated
Version field MUST be included in the Supported Version list to allow the
server to communicate the negotiated version's preference. Note that this
preference is only advisory, clients MAY choose to use their own preference
instead.

Clients MAY include versions following the pattern `0x?a?a?a?a` in their
`Compatible Version` list, and the server in their `Supported Version` list.
Those versions are reserved to exercise version negotiation (see the Versions
section of {{QUIC}}), and MUST be ignored when parsing these fields. On the
other hand, the `Received Negotiation Version` list MUST be identical to the
received Version Negotiation packet, so clients MUST NOT add or remove reserved
version from that list.


# Version Downgrade Prevention {#downgrade}

Clients MUST ignore any received Version Negotiation packets that contain the
version that they initially attempted. Once a client has reacted to a Version
Negotiation packet, it MUST drop all subsequent Version Negotiation packets on
that connection.

Servers MUST validate that the client's `Currently Attempted Version` matches
the version in the long header that carried the handshake version information.
Similarly, clients MUST validate that the server's `Negotiated Version` matches
the long header version. If an endpoint's validation fails, it MUST close the
connection. If the connection was using QUIC version 1, it MUST be closed with
a transport error of type `VERSION_NEGOTIATION_ERROR`.

When a server parses the client's handshake version information, if the
`Received Negotiation Version Count` is not zero, the server MUST validate that
it could have sent the Version Negotation packet described by the client in
response to a first flight of version `Previously Attempted Version`. In
particular, the server MUST ensure that there are no versions that it supports
that are absent from the Received Negotiation Versions, and that the ordering
matches the server's preference. If this validation fails, the server MUST
close the connection. If the connection was using QUIC version 1, it MUST be
closed with a transport error of type `VERSION_NEGOTIATION_ERROR`. This
mitigates an attacker's ability to forge Version Negotiation packets to force a
version downgrade.

If a server operator is progressively deploying a new QUIC version throughout
its fleet, it MAY perform a two-step process where it first progressively adds
support for the new version, but without enforcing its presence in `Received
Negotiation Versions`. Once all servers have been upgraded, the second step is
to start enforcing that the new version is present in `Received Negotiation
Versions`. This opens connections to version downgrades during the upgrade
window, since those could be due to clients communicating with both upgraded
and non-upgraded servers.

If an endpoint receives its peer's Handshake Version Information and fails to
parse it (for example, if it is too short), then the endpoint MUST close the
connection. If the connection was using QUIC version 1, it MUST be closed with
a transport error of type `TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR`.


# Supported Versions

The server's `Supported Version` list allows it to communicate the full list of
versions it supports to the client. In the case where clients initially attempt
connections with the oldest version they support, this allows them to be
notified of more recent versions the server supports. If the client notices
that the server supports a version that is more preferable that the one
initially attempted by default, the client SHOULD cache that information and
attempt the preferred version in subsequent connections.


# Client Choice of Original Version

The client's first flight SHOULD be sent using the version that the server is
most likely to support (in the absence of other information, this will often be
the oldest version the client supports).


# Interaction with Retry

QUIC version 1 features retry packets, which the server can send to validate
the client's IP address before parsing the client's first flight. This impacts
compatible version negotiation because a server who wishes to send a retry
packet before parsing the client's first flight won't have parsed the client's
handshake version information yet. If a future document wishes to define
compatibility between two versions that support retry, that document MUST
specify how version negotiation (both compatible and incompatible) interacts
with retry during a handshake that requires both. For example, that could be
accomplished by having the server send a retry packet first and validating the
client's IP address before starting version negotiation and deciding whether to
use compatible version negotiation on that connection (in that scenario the
retry packet would be sent using the original version).


# Interaction with 0-RTT

QUIC version 1 allows sending data from the client to the server during the
handshake, by using 0-RTT packets. If a future document wishes to define
compatibility between two versions that support 0-RTT, that document MUST
address the scenario where there are 0-RTT packets in the client's first
flight. For example, this could be accomplished by defining which
transformations are applied to 0-RTT packets. Alternatively, that document
could specify that compatible version negotiation causes 0-RTT data to be
rejected by the server.


# Considerations for Future Versions

In order to facilitate the deployment of future versions of QUIC, designers of
future versions SHOULD attempt to design their new version such that commonly
deployed versions are compatible with it. For example, a successor to QUIC
version 1 may wish to design its transport parameters in a way that does not
preclude compatibility. Additionally, frames in QUIC version 1 do not use a
self-describing encoding, so unrecognized frame types cannot be parsed or
ignored (see the Extension Frames section of {{QUIC}}); this means that new
versions that wish to be very similar to QUIC version 1 and compatible with it
should avoid introducing new frames in initial packets.


# Security Considerations

The security of this version negotiation mechanism relies on the authenticity
of the handshake version information exchanged during the handshake. In QUIC
version 1, transport parameters are authenticated ensuring the security of this
mechanism. Negotiation between compatible versions will have the security of
the weakest common version.

The requirement that versions not be assumed compatible mitigates the
possibility of cross-protocol attacks, but more analysis is still needed here.

The presence of the `Attempted Version` and `Negotiated Version` fields
mitigates an attacker's ability to forge packets by altering the version.
